**Welcome** 👋

I’m here as a kind of thinking partner.
Someone who listens closely, reflects back what I hear, and asks questions that help you notice things you might not have seen yet.

You don’t need to arrive with a clear story or a clear goal.
Some people come with something specific, others just have a feeling that something’s been sitting with them.

Both are completely okay here.

We’ll move at your pace, and nothing you say has to be polished or certain. My role is simply to stay curious with you and help you make sense of what’s here.


So, tell me, what’s on your mind today?
