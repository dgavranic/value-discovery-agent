Assess whether we have sufficient information to move from RAPPORT BUILDING to VALUE DISCOVERY.

Current Knowledge:
{{ knowledge_context }}

Recent conversation (last 6 turns):
{{ conversation_history }}

Turn count in this stage: {{ turn_count }}

Completion criteria:
✓ At least ONE concrete, specific goal identified (not vague)
✓ Problem described with multiple details (obstacles, context, specifics)
✓ User has shared enough context to explore values from
✓ User seems ready to go deeper (not holding back significantly)

Warning signs to continue:
⚠ Goals are still vague or unclear
⚠ User giving very short responses consistently
⚠ Only surface-level information
⚠ Seems to have more to share but needs encouragement

User intent signals:
- Getting repetitive or saying "that's it" = may want to move on
- Shorter answers after being engaged = may be ready
- Still elaborating meaningfully = continue this stage

Force advancement conditions:
- If turn_count >= 8: Must advance (sufficient attempts)
- If turn_count >= 5 AND at least 1 concrete goal: Should advance

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "should_advance": true/false,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "confidence": "low|medium|high",
  "missing_elements": ["list what's still needed, if any"]
}
