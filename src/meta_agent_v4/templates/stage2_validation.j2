Assess whether we have sufficient value discovery to move to ACTION PLANNING.

Current Knowledge:
{{ knowledge_context }}

Turn count in this stage: {{ turn_count }}
Values discovered: {{ value_count }}

Completion criteria:
✓ At least 3-4 distinct values identified
✓ Each value has supporting rationale/context
✓ User has explored WHY these values matter (went deeper)
✓ Some sense of prioritization or relative importance
✓ Values feel authentic and grounded (not superficial)

Warning signs to continue:
⚠ Values are too vague or generic
⚠ Haven't explored the "why" deeply enough
⚠ No sense of which values are most important
⚠ User is still discovering new insights

User readiness signals:
- Insights slowing down = may be ready
- Confirmed their key values = ready
- Asked "what's next" = ready
- Still having "aha moments" = continue

Force advancement conditions:
- If turn_count >= 10: Must advance
- If turn_count >= 6 AND value_count >= 3: Should advance

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "should_advance": true/false,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "confidence": "low|medium|high",
  "values_quality": "superficial|developing|deep"
}
